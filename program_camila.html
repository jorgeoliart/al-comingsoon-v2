            <h2>The plan</h2>
            <p>This is our map for the next ten sessions. Our main goal is to help you feel more confident and comfortable speaking and understanding English, so you can use it to connect with others in a way that feels true to you.</p>
            
            <h3>Our approach for this program is:</h3>

                <!-- LIST ITEM 3: Star removed, text updated, bolding added with <strong> -->
